# Martin in the Funny House

## Participants:

- Anton Nilsson, antni004@student.liu.se
- Morgan Nordberg, morno368@student.liu.se

## Bried description

We will make a scene where a 3D model of Martin HÃ¶gstedt walks around in a "fun
house"(inspired by the houses at amusement parks that have bent/warped
mirrors). The scene will have various kinds of bent mirrors. As the project
evolves, we'll make the mirror technique configurable, and explore various ways
to achieve mirror effects

## Will do:

- Textures
- SkyBox
- light
- 3D models
- Camera movement
- CubeMap mirrors

## Might do:
    
- BumpMap mirrors
- raycasted mirrors
- Collision detection
- Noisemap for "splattering" "maskrosor" onto the ground
- Shadows
- Truman door (a way to exit the skybox)
